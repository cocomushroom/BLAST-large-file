**These script deal with files containing large amount of sequences that take a long time to BLAST**


**Divide assembled transcripts into many many files, Need to change fasta file name in the script:**


python split_bigfile.py


**submit multiple jobs on cluster. Notice all of the transcripts files have to be in the same folder:**


./ subMultiBLAST.sh

**After all the BLASTed search, the results are saved in .xml format in .NROut files, extract the transcripts that BLASTED to FungalNR database, When ran on slurm Cluster: **


sbatch List_BLAST.sh


**When on mac computer:**


./BLASTxml_query_grep



**After obtain the list of transcript names, use the names to extract transcript sequences from the original assembled transcript file:**


python extract_byID.py â€œinputname" "list" "outputname"


**Use the extracted sequences to do the downstream analyses:**
